# Learning-ML
This repository serves as my progression through machine learning concepts. I plan to program in Python and C++, depending on what seems most enjoyable at the moment

## Linear Regression
This is the starting point, a single linear regression. The <code>data.csv</code> file is a 2 column csv, since this regression only handles 2 variables.

## Multivariable Linear Regression
This is the next logical point. <code>data.csv</code> contains a more complex data set, which is sorted again. This model now uses linear algebra, and multiple variables to create prediction. This model also introduces training at a very basic level.
